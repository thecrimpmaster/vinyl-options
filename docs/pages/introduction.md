Welcome friend!

So, the intention of this project is to **explore** the full stack of a web app. It will try and focus on
what I consider to be **good** (not best, there is no such thing) practice, and **options**.

It's opinionated in some ways, mainly through the choice of technologies, so apologies if your technology
of choice is not here, but hopefully some of the content might be useful.
  
It's loosely structured in two parts. 

1. Setting up and configuring a project. This will focus on configuration options for the 
various pieces of chosen technology, and will try and really explain in detail what each line of the 
configuration is doing.
  * (Local and production environments and deployments, testing frameworks, front end tools, databases)

2. Designing and developing the web app itself. This will be a more exploratory exercise, hopefully 
demonstrating that there are many ways to get the same result and how you 
approach a problem is **always** contextual (project lifetime, budget, maintainability, changeability...)
